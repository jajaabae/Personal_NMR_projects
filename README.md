These two projects have been made with only the focus of making the tools quickly. This has resulted in two NMR-tools which have been extremely helpful in my Master's Thesis, but the code has a lower-than-ideal degree of readability.

# NMR_Spectra_viewer
This project is made to display grids of spectra slices. It was developed during some more than a weekend, and later improved for visual experience as I got approval to include the output in my thesis.

# NMR_data_representation_and_table_exportation
This project was initiated about over a year ago, before I had even made a single class in Python.
The stages of development were:
- 4 Hour prototype-coding to see if it was feasible
- 1 week of converting and developing the prototype into a useful tool
- Some modifications while using it in daily/weekly work for about 4 months
- 1 week of modularizing and adding new desired functionalities
- Continuous use of the program with some modifications for over 6 more months.
This development process structured by ad hoc requirements has affected both the structure and the readability of the code. Especially as it was never intended for others eyes.
