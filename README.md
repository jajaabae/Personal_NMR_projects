These two projects have been made with only the focus of making the tools quickly. This has resulted in two NMR-tools which have been extremely helpful in my Master's Thesis, but the code has a lower-than-ideal degree of readability.

I have included some representative .png files in the main folder of each of the two project.

# NMR_Spectra_viewer
This project is made to display grids of spectra slices. It was developed during some more than a weekend, and later improved for visual experience as I got approval to include the output in my thesis.

# NMR_data_representation_and_table_exportation
This project was initiated about over a year ago, before I had even made a single class in Python.
The stages of development were:
- 4 Hour prototype-coding to see if it was feasible
- 1 week of converting and developing the prototype into a useful tool
- Some modifications while using it in daily/weekly work for about 4 months
- 1 week of modularizing and adding new desired functionalities
- Continuous use of the program with some modifications for over 6 more months.
This development process structured by ad hoc requirements has affected both the structure and the readability of the code. Especially as it was never intended for others' eyes.

# On YouTube
I have made a YouTube video explaining the background for these programs and how they work in tandem with some commercially available NMR software.
I recommend to view from the Time-lapse (5:42) or conclusion part (9:54) of the video as it otherwise is a bit long for the format.

Other time points can be found in the video description.
